    Panel Type
  </p>
  <p>
    Most common computer screens are of two types IPS LCD display and LED display. IPS panels are powered by a backlight, so they produce brighter images. The image quality of IPS panels is better compared to LED. However, IPS panel consume more power, generate heat and have lower contrast ratio.<br>
    LED panels have high contrast ratio and refresh rates.

    Resolution
  </p>
  <p>
    Screen resolution refers to the number of pixels and density. Higher the resolution, greater is the image quality and detail.<br>
    Higher resolution screens are more expensive. An FHD screen should be ideal for gaming.<br>
    720P = 1280 	&times; 720 - HD <br>
    1080P = 1920 	&times; 1080 - FHD <br>
    2K = 2560 	&times; 1440 - QHD <br>
    4K = 3840 	&times; 2160 - 4K<br>

    Refresh Rate
  </p>
  <p>
    The refresh rate refers to how many times per second the display is able to draw a new image. This is measured in Hertz (Hz). For example, if your display has a refresh rate of 60 Hz, it is updating the image 60 times per second. The time between these updates is measured in milliseconds (ms), which should be around 1 - 0.5 ms for a good screen.<br>
   For gaming it is ideal to have 144 Hz refresh rate.
